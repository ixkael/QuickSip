# QuickSip
Pipeline to quickly project Survey Image Properties (e.g. seeing, sky noise, airmass) onto the sky into Healpix maps using flexible weighting schemes. Initially designed to produce maps of observing condition related sources of systematics for the Dark Energy Survey, but will work with any multi-epoch survey and collection of images with valid WCS information.
